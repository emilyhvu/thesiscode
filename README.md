# Thesis Code
This is where the scripts and code relevant to my thesis data generation,
acquisition, and processing resides. 

My dissertation repository that houses the content of my dissertation and
relevant .tex files is located here: https://github.com/munkm/dissertation

My other code that is publicly accessible is available on my [github user
profile page](munkm.github.io).
